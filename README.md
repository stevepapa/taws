## Installation

### From Source

taws is built with Rust. Make sure you have Rust 1.70+ installed.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/huseyinbabal/taws.git
cd taws

# Build and run
cargo build --release
./target/release/taws
```

### Using Cargo

```bash
cargo install taws
```

### Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

```bash
brew install huseyinbabal/tap/taws
```

---

## Prerequisites

- **AWS Credentials** - Configure your AWS credentials using one of:
  - `aws configure` (AWS CLI)
  - Environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`)
  - IAM roles (when running on EC2/ECS/Lambda)
  - AWS profiles in `~/.aws/credentials`

- **IAM Permissions** - Your AWS user/role needs appropriate read permissions for the services you want to browse. At minimum, you'll need `Describe*` and `List*` permissions.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Launch taws with default profile
taws

# Launch with a specific profile
taws --profile production

# Launch in a specific region
taws --region us-west-2
```

## Architecture

taws follows a data-driven architecture where AWS resource definitions are stored as JSON configuration files. This makes it easy to add new resource types without writing new code.

```
src/
├── resources/          # JSON resource definitions (one per service)
│   ├── ec2.json
│   ├── lambda.json
│   ├── s3.json
│   └── ...
├── resource/
│   ├── registry.rs     # Resource registry and loading
│   ├── fetcher.rs      # Generic resource fetcher
│   └── sdk_dispatch.rs # AWS SDK dispatch (the only SDK code)
├── aws/
│   ├── client.rs       # AWS client management
│   └── profiles.rs     # AWS profile handling
└── ui/
    ├── table.rs        # Resource table view
    ├── details.rs      # Resource details view
    └── ...
```

### Adding a New Resource Type

1. Add a JSON definition in `src/resources/<service>.json`
2. Add the SDK client to `src/aws/client.rs`
3. Add the SDK dispatch handler to `src/resource/sdk_dispatch.rs`

No other code changes required!

---

## Configuration

taws looks for AWS credentials in the standard locations:
- `~/.aws/credentials`
- `~/.aws/config`
- Environment variables

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `AWS_PROFILE` | Default AWS profile to use |
| `AWS_REGION` | Default AWS region |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | AWS access key |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | AWS secret key |
| `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` | AWS session token (for temporary credentials) |

---

## Known Issues

- Some resources may require specific IAM permissions not covered by basic read-only policies
- Resource counts may vary during loading due to pagination
- Some global services (IAM, Route53, CloudFront) always use us-east-1
